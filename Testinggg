        <p> Welcome To Smileys.<br>
            Smileys is a safe space for people living with Sickle cell anaemia to freely communicate with others like them and learn more about their health. Why the name "Smileys" ? If you've noticed, when you lay the sickle cell flat it looks more like a smile than a sickle. At Smileys we are raising awareness and changing the narrative of sickle cell anaemia. Join us.
